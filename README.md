# Healthy/Unhealthy Rise Seeds Prediction.

Rice is an important oat crop on the planet.
It is used as a stable source of food energy by three-quarters of the world population.
The yield production amount
and nature of the rice grain are influenced by abiotic and biotic 
factors like precipitation, soil ripeness, temperature, bugs, microbes,
infection, and so forth. To manage diseases, Farmers are investing a lot 
of energy and assets, But For identifying the diseases they are
relying on their eyesight which prompts undesirable cultivation.
  
The advancement of technical support in agriculture 
greatly assists for automatic 
identification of infectious organisms in the 
rice Seeds.The convolutional neural network algorithm (CNN)
is one of the algorithms in deep learning that has 
been triumphantly invoked for solving computer vision 
problems like image classification, 
object segmentation, image analysis, etc
In My work, I have used CNN model for detecting healthy and unhealthy 
seeds The parameters of the proposed model are optimized for the classification task 
and obtained a good accuracy of 96.34% on training set and 86% for the test set.
